I am a machine learning researcher at [RISE Research Institutes of Sweden](https://www.ri.se/), specializing in [deep learning](https://dl-group.se/). Additionally, I am completing my PhD at Uppsala University under the supervision of [Thomas B. Schön](https://www.uu.se/kontakt-och-organisation/personal?query=N13-1742). My research primarily focuses on applying and developing machine learning for the sciences, particularly chemistry and fluid simulation. Geometric deep learning is essential in these areas, making it a central part of my work.
