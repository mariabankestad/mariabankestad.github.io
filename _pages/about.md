I'm a machine learning researcher at [RISE Research Institutes of Sweden](https://www.ri.se/) and also in the final stages of my PhD at Uppsala University, under the supervision of [Thomas B. Schön](https://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html). I specialize in [deep learning](https://dl-group.se/) and applications of machine learning in sciences such as chemistry and fluid simulation. Because of the importance of geometry in these areas, geometric deep learning is a central theme in my research.
